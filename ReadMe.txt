This file contains a few tips that can help you ;)

Pressing Alt+R or Ctrl+R invokes Most Recently Viewed list menu.

Pressing ESC or Alt+X quits the program.

If you're not happy about 500Kb file size limit, you can remove it by setting
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\DAMN\DAMN NFO Viewer\MaxFileSizeKb to 0

If you want to use other fonts for viewing (installed on your system), set
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\DAMN\DAMN NFO Viewer\BuiltinFontsOnly to 0
(this may increase program's startup time on Asian/Arabic versions of Windows XP)

There's no help file. Instead, please use the Settings dialog's tooltips. They contain detailed descriptions of corresponding settings.

To uninstall the program, go to its directory and run UnInstall.exe.
